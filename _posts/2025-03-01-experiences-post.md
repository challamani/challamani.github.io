First company is always special to everyone; we will never forget the experience and memories. - 2yrs @Cultuzz (April 2013 to March 2015)

### My First Company Experience â€“ A Journey to Remember

Your first company always holds a special place in your heart. The experiences, the lessons, and the memories stay with you forever. If youâ€™re lucky enough to start your career with a great team, it makes the journey even more special. And honestly, I consider myself one of the lucky ones.
A first job isnâ€™t just about learning technology, it shapes your career path and influences the way you think. Many people form their professional outlook based on their early experiences, and for me, Cultuzz played a major role in that.

Rather than just talking about the work itself, I want to share more about the people, friendships, and incidents that made my time at Cultuzz so memorable. But first, letâ€™s talk about what I worked on.

I was lucky to work under an inspiring and supportive leader, surrounded by ridiculously smart colleagues, who also happened to be my PG classmates and friends. They never missed a chance to scold me like a strict school teacher, roast me like a weekend barbecue, and praise me like a proud parent all in perfect balance, but I realised after I left the company, working with your own people is not just easier, it's a lot more fun. 
After all, a known devil is always better than an unknown angel! ðŸ˜„

### My Work at Cultuzz

When I joined, I started working on two major modules:
- Accounting Module: This system generates automatic invoices based on allocated tariffs and had schedulers that communicated with eBay and PayPal to fetch product sales fee details.
- CultBay: This platform is responsible for posting offers on eBay. In collaboration with CultBay, we retrieve and process payment notifications from PayPal.

Before I joined the accounting module built in Core PHP, we first worked on bug fixes before fully rebuilding it in Java.
Additionally, we integrated the system with PayPal, enabling it to receive payment notifications and process payment cancellations efficiently.

### More Than Just Work

Beyond coding, my time at Cultuzz was filled with learning, collaboration, and great friendships. It wasnâ€™t just about the projectsâ€”it was about the people who made each challenge enjoyable. Looking back, I realize how much my first company shaped my journey, and for that, Iâ€™ll always be grateful.

Now it's time for the big pages, I'll share all the things that I remembered, coming soon...!
