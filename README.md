👋 Hello, I’m Mani!

🔍 Passionate about designing and implementing reusable components, whether as libraries or services.

🌱 Currently working on building a secure API platform, using cutting edge technologies in Kubernetes with a strong emphasis on security. I’m also expanding my knowledge of advanced cloud deployment/release techniques.

💻 In my free time, I love writing code, designing workflows for complex business scenarios, and exploring Blockchain technology for smart contracts.
